# This script is a simple, brute-force method for finding records that
# exhibit certain characteristics in the public Cocina JSON for testing.
#
# It queries purl-fetcher for all DRUIDs released to a specific target and
# then fetches each corresponding public Cocina record from PURL and examines it.
#
# You need to be on VPN to do this, as the purl-fetcher API is only accessible
# from within the Stanford network.
#
# To use, modify any of the noted items below, then run:
# $ bundle exec ruby script/find_records.rb
#
# You can exit early with Ctrl-C, and it will report how many records were
# checked before exiting. Running through an entire target will take awhile,
# on the order of 30 minutes or more.

# i.e. "Searchworks", "Earthworks", etc.

# Modify this expression to match the JSON path you want to search, or just
# modify the `examine_record` method directly.

# Modify this method as needed to change what you're looking for in each record.
# It takes a CocinaRecord object and should return an array of [path, result] pairs.
